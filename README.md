# website-design-system

In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your website.
Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. 
Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! 
It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, 
but it can be extended to as many other areas as you’d like.
